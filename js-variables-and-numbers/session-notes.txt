Variable - containers for storing data

Var - old
Let - new - can change
Const - new - constant, won't change

Primitive types - numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, null, BigInt, Symbol 
Reference - objects, arrays, functions, date
Let nameVariable = 3;
Const myV = 10;

Use camel case
Write out all the words
Longer names better than shorter

<script src="" defer ></script> - defer allows the html to load before the javascript kicks in 

console.log('hi');
console.clear();

Var oldUse = 'Try not to use me!';
Let = "use me!"

console.log('oldUse',oldUse); write var every time
 myBigInt = 2n - use n after to reserve more space 


myArray = [] (square brackets) can have more than one data type inside

myObject = {
	cohort name: "Vanilla",
amountStudents:10,
knowsJs: true,
}; curly brackets

Null for when you want to leave a variable empty - otherwise will come up undefined

parseInt - change string into number
Typeof<var> will give you the type of the variable

subStringNumber = isNumber - amIaNumber
